# MATLAB-ADD-AND-REMOVE-NOISE
This project focuses on improving audio quality by investigating noise addition and reduction techniques in audio signals. Initially, we will add controlled noise to a clean audio signal to create a noisy environment. Then, we will design and apply a bandpass filter to effectively remove the introduced noise.
